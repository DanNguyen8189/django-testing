to run the regular tests, where we test urls, views, models, and forms, run python manage.py test budget
to run functional tests (selenium), run python manage.py test functional_tests
the functional tests use selenium's chromedriver; make sure chromedriver is in the correct directory

Note: testing folders, if used, need an __init__.py file so that the test driver can recognize it!
